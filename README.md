# SelfDrivingCar
This project using an Arduino Uno aims to realize a car able both to drive both automatically and sending commands from a PC, using a Processing GUI, connected with the car through two Xbee devices.

The code doesn't use the Arduino Libraries but it directly writes and reads directly using AVR commands.

In addition it sends the value of LDR sensor, and eventually turns two LEDs on.
